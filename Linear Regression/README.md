# Linear Regression in Python with Scikit-Learn

There are five basic steps when youâ€™re implementing linear regression:

-Import the packages and classes you need.

-Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.

-Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.

-Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.

-Apply the model for predictions.


# 1. Linear Regression Intro :

  This jupyter notebook contains basics of Linear Regression model, how to implement the model.

  Dataset used : Weather.csv


# 2. Linear Regression Models :

  This jupyter notebook contains  implememtation of different models starting from Simple Linear Regression Model to Cross Validation Model   to Ridge Model and Lasso Model.

  Also it includes what all the Hyperparameters that are important during modelling.
  Moreover Preprossing of data and Pipeline is also explained in this jupyter notebook.

  Dataset used : Gapminder.csv
