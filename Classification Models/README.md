# Classification Algorithms

Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”

There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each.

## Types of Classification Models:
The study of classification in statistics is vast, and there are several types of classification algorithms you can use depending on the dataset you’re working with.
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machines**
4. **Decision Trees**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **Naive Bayes**
