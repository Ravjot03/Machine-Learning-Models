# Classification Algorithms

Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”

There are many different types of classification tasks that you may encounter in machine learning and specialized approaches to modeling that may be used for each.

## Types of Classification Models:
The study of classification in statistics is vast, and there are several types of classification algorithms you can use depending on the dataset you’re working with.
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machines**
4. **Decision Trees**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **Naive Bayes**

## [Project-1](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/master/Classification%20Models/Project-1)
In this project, I have explained basics of different types of classification models and their implementations.

Models covered -
- Logistic Regression Model
- Decision Tree Classifier
- KNearest Neighbors Model
- Support Vector Machines Classifier

## [Project-2](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/master/Classification%20Models/Project-2)
In this project, I have built a classifier to predict Diabetes disease.

- Implemented k-NN Classification Model.
- Applied Cross Validation to estimate our model's accuracy.
- Getting the Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.
- Applying Hyperparameters
  - GridSearchCV
  - RandomizedSearchCV
- Implemented Ridge Classification Model
- Implemented Support Vector Machines Classifier

Worked on Diabetes Disease dataset and can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.[(link)](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Classification%20Models/Project-2/diabetess.csv)
