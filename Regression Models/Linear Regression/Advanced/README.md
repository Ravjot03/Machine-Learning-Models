# Linear Regression Model - Advanced Concepts

In this jupyter notebook, I have built different types of linear regression models.

1. Built a **Simple Linear Regression Model**
2. Applied **Cross Validation Method** to evaluate model's accuracy.
3. Applied **Regularized Regression Models**
    - Ridge Regression Model
    - Lasso Regression Model
4. Pre-processing data and Hyperparameters tuning using Pipelines
    - Simple Imputer, Standard Scaler
    - Elastic Net Regularization Regression Model

## Data info -
Worked on Gapminder Data, to predict the life expectancy in a given country based on features such as the country's GDP, fertility rate, and population.

The dataset is already provided in the repository. [(link)](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Regression%20Models/Linear%20Regression/Advanced/gapminder.csv)
