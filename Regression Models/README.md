## What is Regression Analysis ?
Regression analysis is a predictive modelling technique that analyzes the relation between the target or dependent variable and independent variable in a dataset. This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

Regression analysis is an important tool for modelling and analyzing data. Here, we fit a curve / line to the data points, in such a manner that the differences between the distances of data points from the curve or line is minimized.
